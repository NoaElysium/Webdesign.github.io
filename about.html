      <h2> About Me </h2>
        
      <p> 
Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I'm Noa, a passionate photographer dedicated to capturing the beauty and essence of the world around us. With a camera in hand and an eye for detail, I strive to tell stories through my lens, creating images that evoke emotion and inspire curiosity. 
</p>

                    <h2> My Journey </h2>

<p> 
My journey into photography began at age 10 when i got my first camera at Christmas. When I first picked up a camera and discovered the magic of capturing moments. What started as a hobby quickly evolved into a lifelong passion, leading me to pursue formal training at Sava School of Photography. Since then, I've been fortunate to transform my passion into a thriving career.
</p>

                      <h2> My Approach </h2>

<p>
I believe that photography is not just about taking pictures but about capturing the essence of a moment. Whether I'm photographing a stunning landscape, a candid portrait, or an intimate event, my goal is to create images that resonate with authenticity and emotion. I take pride in my ability to connect with my subjects, ensuring that each photograph tells a unique story.
</p>

                         <h2> Specialties </h2>

<p>
I specialize in portrait, landscape, and event photography, but I'm always eager to explore new challenges and expand my creative horizons. My work has been featured in vanity affair, blanc magazine, and I've had the privilege of working with clients ranging from different industries around the world.
